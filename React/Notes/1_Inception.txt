- React uses JSX(Javascript xml) syntax.
- Using CDN we can pull out to run react code into out index.html
- What are CDN?
- CDN are content delivery network, through this we inject react internal functionality into out project.

- 'createElement' method of react takes up 3 argument and gives out a react object.
- Three arguments are:-
    a) html tag
    b) props (property)
    c) inner content
- ReactDOM's 'render' method will take the element created from the above method and renders it out to make a HTML element which we then see on the screen.
