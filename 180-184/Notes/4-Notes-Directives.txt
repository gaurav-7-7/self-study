Structural Directives
- These are responsible for changing the structure of the DOM. Adding or removing the elements from the DOM.
- Structural directives always have (*) prefix whereas Attribute directives doesn't have any prefix as such
- Most popular structural directives are: 
    * NgIf - used to create or remove part of DOM tree depending on a condition ( there is another way to acheive this usign hidden property but in "hidden" case the element is not removed from the DOM rather its hidden in the DOM.)
    * NgFor - used for displaying a list of items using repetitive loops
    * NgSwitch - its just like switch case but used to display one element from among several possible elements, based on switch condition.
