Pipes
- pipes are functions that formats the input and transforms it into desired output formats (eg: format a number to output the result upto two decimal places)
- we can also do so using functions but using functions will be hard when we want to nest mutiple formater functions which is why its better to use pipes

Built-in Pipes
- DatePipes : Formats a date value according to locale rules.
- UpperCasePipes : Transforms text to all upper case.
- LowerCasePipes : Transforms text to all lower case.
- CurrencyPipes : Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
- DecimalPipes : Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.
- PercentPipes : Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.

Custom Pipes
- Using the cli we can create custom pipes ( ng generate pipe <pipeName>)
- the above wil add our custom pipe to our app.module.ts
- generating a pipe in such a way will create our file with some pre-written code with necessary imports and the most important part, transform function
- whatever we return from this transform function would be the new value of the interpolation
