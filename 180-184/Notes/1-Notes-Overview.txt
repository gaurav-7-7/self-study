What is angular?
- angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps
- SPA developed by this framework runs on client-side, but we can also create full stack applications by making HTTP request to the server
- angular can also run on server side with something like angular universal

Why use angular?
- create dynamic frontend apps and universal
- its full featured framework (router, http, etc)
- integrated typescript
- uses RxJS library which allows us to use observables that allows us to write efficient asyncronous programming
- popular in large enterprise

Angular components
- uses UI components that include the template(HTML), logic and styling
- these components are reusable and can be embedded into the template as an XML (like a tag)
- components are class based as well

Angular Services
- angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability
- this cleans up our components and makes it clean rather than putting all the functionality into components
- services are classes built to handle one task/aspect of the application (data fetching, input validation, implement logic, external interaction)
