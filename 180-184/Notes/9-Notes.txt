Purpose of services
- services are nothing but a class with specific Purpose
- this purpose can be :
    * sharing data between components
    * implement application logic
    * external interaction

Dependency injection 
- is a coding concept in which the class receives its dependencies from external source rather than creating them itself.
- to use these dependencies we must register these service using injectors and declare as dependencies in the components.

Observables
- these are sequence of items that arrive asyncronously over time when we perform HTTP call
- we must subscribe to these observable to obtain the value emitted by the observable
- we unsubscribe from an observable to stop getting data from that stream of data

Subject
- subjects are special type of observable and are like event emitter used for cross component interaction.
