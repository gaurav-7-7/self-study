        <!--
            - whenever we want to send some data from the front end to the back end, we make use of the form component.
            - forms are very essential component for a website which happens to have a lot of user interaction.
            - there are various kind of input elements that we can take from a form, be it name, password, date, etc.
        -->
        <h2>Input elements</h2>
        <label>Name:</label> 
        <input type="text" id="name"><br />
        <label>Date:</label> 
        <input type="date" id="date"><br />
        <label>Password:</label> 
        <input type="password" id="password"><hr />
        <!--
            - including labels help in increasing accesibility of the webpage and also help in styling the individual elements on webpage 
        -->

        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <form action="message.html" method="post">
            <label>Name:</label> 
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br />
            <label>Date:</label> 
            <input type="date" id="date" name="start-date"><br />
            <label>Email:</label>
            <input type="email" name="email" id="email">
            <label>Password:</label> 
            <input type="password" id="password" name="pass">
            <button>Submit</button><br />
            <!-- 
                - If not specified a form by default sends data to itself on submit.
                - form sends data to the backend using the query string which is the key-value pair of name attribute and the typed value
                - to send data to another page we add the action attribute to the form tag which will have the relative path as value to which we want to navigate on submit.
                - methods attribute take different values which are http verbs like get, post, etc which tell what kind of action to take on the data.
                - when we want to 'get' data from the backend we use get and when we want to send data we use 'post'
                - apart from query string parameters there is one more way to send data to the backend that is through the http request body which is a more secure way to send data as the data is hidden away. Passwords and credit card informations are sent through this way to keep the sensitive information secure.
